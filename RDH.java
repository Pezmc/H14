/* T5: Plan the implementation (10 minutes):  Use the Java programming language to implement the  design 
obtained in T3 and T4 into a working system.

This system, to be called “IBMS-RDH”, is a subsystem of the 
IBMS. Since each team will build your own IBMS-RDH, I suggest that you name your team’s IBMS-RDH as 
“teamID- IBMS-RDH”

For example, H3-IBMS-RDH is for team H3; G5-IBMS-RDH is for team G5, and 
I8-IBMS-RDH is for team I8. Before starting implementation, you should plan the implementation tasks and 
decide who does what by when. The main implementation tasks are: 
  T5-1: Implement the design classes; 
  T5-2: Implement the user interface; 
  T5-3: Connect the design classes to the IBMS bus database; 
  T5-4: Test the system (hint: test examples can be used for demonstration in Week 4).

The interface should be interactive such that it will ask the user to enter the holiday request information and 
display the approved holidays on the screen

/*

4.	A completely working system for UC1 is defined as follows:
a.	Its interface is interactive: it asks for the input and displays the output, and its display is understandable, clear, neat and near professional.
b.	Given the driver ID as the input, the interface shows the number of holidays that the driver has.
c.	The driver selects specific dates for the holidays and the interface will display one of the two outcomes: (1) holidays granted; (2) holidays rejected due to invalid dates. 
d.	The above operations should be repeatable without crashing the system.
