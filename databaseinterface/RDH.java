/* This class needs */

/* T5: Plan the implementation (10 minutes):  Use the Java programming language to implement the  design 
obtained in T3 and T4 into a working system.

This system, to be called “IBMS-RDH”, is a subsystem of the 
IBMS. Since each team will build your own IBMS-RDH, I suggest that you name your team’s IBMS-RDH as 
“teamID- IBMS-RDH”

For example, H3-IBMS-RDH is for team H3; G5-IBMS-RDH is for team G5, and 
I8-IBMS-RDH is for team I8. Before starting implementation, you should plan the implementation tasks and 
decide who does what by when. The main implementation tasks are: 
  T5-1: Implement the design classes; 
  T5-2: Implement the user interface; 
  T5-3: Connect the design classes to the IBMS bus database; 
  T5-4: Test the system (hint: test examples can be used for demonstration in Week 4).
